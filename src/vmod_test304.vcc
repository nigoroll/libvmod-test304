$Module test304 3 Test for 304 responses in vcl_deliver

Lets you detect if the current response will end up as a ``304 Not
Modified``. Must only be used in ``vcl_deliver``.

The ``304`` logic in Varnish depends on whether or not any of the relevant
headers were altered in ``vcl_deliver``, so in general we can't know until
after vcl_deliver if this response will end up as a ``304``.

To rely on the result from the ``is_304()`` function, you must not
alter either of the following after the call::

      req.http.If-Modified-Since
      req.http.If-None-Match

Varnish uses the headers of the fetched object (not the copy in
``resp.http.*``) when deciding if it will do a ``304``, so stripping
off ``resp.http.Etag`` or ``resp.http.Last-Modified`` in
``vcl_deliver`` will prevent the client from seeing these, but will
not prevent Varnish from serving a ``304``.

$Function BOOL is_304()

Returns ``true`` if this response will end up as a ``304``. Do not
invoke this from outside of ``vcl_deliver``.  Example::

    sub vcl_deliver {
	if (test304.is_304()) {
	    set resp.http.foo = "this is a 304";
	}
    }
